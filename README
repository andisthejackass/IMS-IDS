!!!IMPORTANT!!!
Make sure to backup your iptables rules before running iptables.sh



Requirements
--------------------
1) A C compiler (gcc for example)
2) iptables (which is embeded in linux systems, so you're probably OK)
3) libpcap 



Installation
--------------------
Just compile the program using
	gcc ims.c -o ims -lpcap
and you should have an "ims" executable in the same folder.



Usage
---------------------
1)run "iptables.sh" script as root
	sh iptables.sh
2) run "ims" program as root and choose interface
	./ims eth0

As the IMS is running and people use the service, you shall see a lot of
messages rushing through your terminal - that means in works ;)
